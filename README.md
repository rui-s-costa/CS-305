## 1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

My client for this class was Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its clients' savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial sought to add a file verification step to its web application to ensure secure communications.

## 2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I feel I was able to identify false positives when checking for vulnerabilities in the client's project. It's important to code securely to reduce the chance of exposing the code to vulnerabilities.

## 3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I felt the most challenging was working with the various libraries to gain insight into the vulnerabilities. Besides the libraries, reading the report was also tricky.


## 4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I focused on outdated application libraries as the first means of securing the code base. I then moved on to vulnerabilities that still existed in the current libraries to determine if I needed the library or not. I would want to automate this process in the future with CI/CD.

## 5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?


I ensured the code and application were functional and secure by performing rigorous static and dynamic testing on the code.

## 6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I found the Maven Dependency checker tool to be the most helpful.

## 7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I will show them before and after reports to showcase how I could secure the code.
